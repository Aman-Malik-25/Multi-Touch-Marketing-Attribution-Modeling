Project 2 - Multi-Touch Marketing Attribution Modeling

This project develops an advanced data analytics solution for marketers to gain a true understanding of their campaign effectiveness by moving beyond simplistic "last-touch" attribution. It addresses the common problem where only the final interaction before a conversion gets credit, leading to misinformed budget allocation and an undervaluation of channels that contribute earlier in the customer journey.

Problem Statement

Marketers often struggle with accurately assessing the impact of their various campaigns. Relying solely on "last-touch attribution" – where the channel immediately preceding a conversion receives all the credit – oversimplifies the complex customer journey. This leads to inefficient spending, as valuable early-stage channels (e.g., brand awareness, content discovery) are overlooked, while "closer" channels receive disproportionate credit, regardless of their actual contribution to the overall path to conversion.

Use Case

This solution provides a sophisticated marketing attribution dashboard that maps the complete customer journey across multiple touchpoints. By integrating data from various sources (web analytics, ad platforms, CRM), it allows marketers to visualize how customers interact with different channels before converting. The dashboard applies and compares various attribution models (e.g., Linear, Time-Decay, U-Shaped, First-Touch, Last-Touch) to reveal a more accurate picture of each channel's contribution. This enables smarter budget allocation, optimized campaign strategies, and a clearer understanding of marketing ROI.

Key Modules

  * **Customer Touchpoint Data Integration:** A robust pipeline to ingest touchpoint data from diverse sources such as Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, CRM systems (Salesforce/HubSpot), and potentially other ad platforms or email marketing tools.
  * **Customer Journey Path Visualization:** Interactive visualizations, often utilizing Sankey diagrams, to map and present the common paths customers take through different marketing touchpoints before converting. This helps in understanding the sequence and interplay of channels.
  * **Multi-Touch Attribution Model Calculator:** Implementation of various attribution models using DAX logic, including:
      * **First-Touch:** Credits the initial interaction.
      * **Last-Touch:** Credits the final interaction before conversion.
      * **Linear:** Distributes credit equally across all touchpoints.
      * **Time-Decay:** Gives more credit to recent interactions.
      * **U-Shaped:** Credits the first and last interactions most heavily, with less for middle interactions.
  * **Attribution Model Comparison Dashboard:** A dashboard that allows users to compare the credit distribution across channels under different attribution models, highlighting how channel value shifts based on the chosen model.
  * **Channel ROI and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis:** Features to calculate Return on Investment (ROI) per marketing channel and integrate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) to provide a more holistic view of channel effectiveness.

Technologies Used

  * **Data Sources:** Public APIs (Google Analytics API, Facebook Ads Insights API), CRM exports (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot).
  * **ETL & Modeling:** Power Query (M Language) for data extraction, transformation, and loading; advanced DAX for complex attribution model calculations and data modeling within Power BI.
  * **Visualization Platform:** Microsoft Power BI Desktop for report development and Power BI Service for deployment and interactive dashboards.
  * **Analytics Concepts:** Marketing attribution modeling, customer journey mapping, cohort analysis, and Sankey diagrams for visualizing flow and paths.

Benefits

  * **Accurate Budget Allocation:** Shifts marketing spend to channels that genuinely contribute to conversions across the entire customer journey.
  * **Improved Campaign Performance:** Insights into channel interplay allow for better-integrated and more effective campaign strategies.
  * **Enhanced ROI Measurement:** Provides a more realistic and granular view of the return on marketing investment.
  * **Deeper Customer Understanding:** Visualizes customer paths, revealing common touchpoints and behaviors.
  * **Strategic Decision-Making:** Empowers marketing managers with data-driven insights to optimize their overall marketing strategy and increase efficiency.
